# kamstrup-382Lx7

This is a custom component for ESPhome - to read energy consumption from a Kamstrup 382Lx7 energy meter.

IR eye used built like https://wiki.hal9k.dk/projects/kamstrup

Code inspired from https://github.com/kquinsland/ws3-to-esphome-bridge - and mostly based on https://github.com/Hal9k-dk/kamstrup/tree/master/Software%20eksempler/kamstrup_powermeter

I have this code running on a NodeMCU with an ESP32-Wroom module.
I have tried it on an ESP8266, where ESPhome should use SoftwareSerial - I was not able to get it to work.
